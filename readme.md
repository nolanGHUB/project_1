### PROJECT 1: BLACKJACK
--developed by Nolan Giles / SEI / CHEETAHS
--[Blackjack](blackjacknolan.surge.sh) - Link to live page.

### Technologies used:
- HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT & AXIOS for API GET calls.
- Api used - [deckofcardsapi](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)

### Approach taken
- The large majority of code lies in the javascript.
- Developed at first to run purely in the console and then features/UI was built up from there.
- Initial wireframes designs were adjusted bit by bit until basically unrecognizable from the final product as designs changed to meet the needs of the mechanics.
- After basic foundation mvp was roughly completed features were tacked on bit by bit.

### Instructions
- Users unfamiliar with the game of blackjack can find a short write-up of rules at the bottom of the site.  The only things to be interracted with are the buttons that appear on screen.  Other than that, basic blackjack.
